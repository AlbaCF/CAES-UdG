# Defining Quality: Three Factors

<center>
<img src="img/slide2/quality_factors.png" style="width: 80%; height:80%"/>
</center>

------
# Functional quality

* Meeting the specified requirements
	* <span style="color:green">Project’s sponsors and/or the software’s intended users</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Compliance with applicable laws and regulations</span>
* Creating software that has few defects
	* <span style="color:green">Security, functionality</span>
* Good enough performance
* Ease of learning and ease of use

------

# Process quality

* Meeting delivery dates
	* <span style="color:green">Was the software delivered on time?</span>
* Meeting budgets
	* <span style="color:green">Was the software delivered for the expected amount of money?</span>
* A repeatable development process that reliably delivers quality software
	* <span style="color:green">If a process has the first two attributes but so stresses the development team that its best members quit, it isn’t a quality process.</span>
	* <span style="color:green">True process quality means being consistent from one project to the next.</span>

------

# Not isolated!

* Many connections amongst the 3 aspects of quality

* Positive:
	* <span style="color:green">Improving the process quality usually will improve functional quality</span>

* Negative:
	* <span style="color:green">Speeding up the development can improve the process (meeting deadlines, cutting features) but degrade structural and functional quality</span>

------

# Difference of interest 1/2

* Users
	* <span style="color:green">Care primarly about functional quality</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Likely to care about some aspects of process quality (delivery date)</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Users typically don't care at all about structural quality</span>

* Developers
	* <span style="color:green">Care about structural quality</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Also care about functional quality</span>
		* <span style="color:red">Perhaps a bit less than users since cutting features that users want could make life easier for developers</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Care a lot about process quality, in part because it provides many of the metrics by which they're measured</span>

------

# Difference of interest 2/2

* Sponsors
	* <span style="color:green">Care about everything!</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Sponsors are striving to create business value, and the best way to do it is by taking a broad view of software quality</span>

# Why bother? 2/2

At the XP Day 2009 conference in London, Google’s Mark Striebeck reported on Google’s estimates around the cost of delay in fixing defects:

* <span style="color:red">$5</span> to fix a bug immediately after a programmer had introduced it
* <span style="color:red">$50</span> if it escaped the programmer’s eyes and was found only after running a full build of the project
* <span style="color:red">$500</span> if it was found during an integration test
* <span style="color:red">$5000</span> if it managed to find its way to a system test

# Motivation

Measuring software quality is motivated by at least two reasons:

* Risk Management
	* <span style="color:green">Sofware failure has caused more than inconvenience. Software errors have caused human fatalities</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Causes range from poorly designed user interfaces to direct programming errors</span>
* Cost Management
	* <span style="color:green">An application with good structural software quality costs less to maintain and is easier to understand and change in response to pressing business needs</span>
	* <span style="color:green">Poor application structural quality in core business applications results in cost and schedule overruns and creates waste in the form of rework</span>

# Desirable properties 1/2
<center><h2>(CISQ's Quality model)</h2></center>

* Reliability
	* <span style="color:green">Measures the level of risk and the likelihood of potential application failures</span>
	* <span style="color:green">It also measures the defects injected due to modifications made to the software</span>
* Efficiency
	* <span style="color:green">Especially important for applications in high execution speed environments sudh as algorithmic or transactional processing where performance and scalability are paramount</span>

------

# Desirable properties 1/2
<center><h2>(CISQ's Quality model)</h2></center>

* Security
	* <span style="color:green">A measure of the likelihood of potential security breaches due to poor coding parctices and architecture</span>
	* <span style="color:green">This quantifies the risk of encountering critical vulnerabilities that damage the business</span>
* Maintainability
	* <span style="color:green">Adaptability, portability and tranferability (from one development team to another)</span>
* Size
	* <span style="color:green">It impacts maintainability</span>
